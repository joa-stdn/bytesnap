# ByteSnap: Browser extension to remember what read your online, frictionlessly
This project is the result of the collaboration between Elliot, Sanjit, and Joachim for OpenAI Hackathon AGI House (May 4, 2024).

## Short Description
An AI-powered browser extension designed to help users effortlessly remember and categorize online content they consume, facilitating easy review and retention.

## Inspiration
Recognizing the challenge of retaining information from online reading, we aimed to bridge the gap between consumption and retention, empowering users to spend more time coding and less time re-reading.

## What it Does
With a single click, the extension summarizes articles, categorizes them, and saves both the summary and URL for convenient review on Notion. This streamlined process eliminates the need for manual note-taking or relying on memory, enhancing productivity and knowledge retention.

## Next Steps
- **Near-term:** Develop a feature to generate flashcards importable into Anki for efficient review.
- **Medium-term:** Enhance modularity to enable swapping out steps for workflows that better utilize AI agents, such as saving relevant portions of a page or creating a knowledge graph.
- **Long-term:** Advance towards a sophisticated software that comprehensively captures and processes all viewed content, functioning as a second brain capable of retrieving knowledge upon query.

## Tagline
*Remember what you read online, effortlessly*
